# User-Experience Issues of Selected Websites - University Project

The "User Experience Issues of Selected Websites - University Project" is a web design project created using HTML and CSS. The website showcases various issues related to information retrieval on a sample website, as well as user-experience problems on a website that I had previously created. This project was developed as part of the Websites User-Experience course, where I had the opportunity to gain practical experience in identifying and addressing issues related to user experience on websites. Overall, this project allowed me to apply the skills and knowledge that I acquired throughout the course and provided valuable insights into the importance of user-centered design in website development. Additionally, the HTML and CSS files that I prepared were validated by W3C website validation tool.
